<h1 style="text-align:center">The Tale of the Dragon and the Three Brothers</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">A chavacano folktale</h3>
<p>From <i>“Zamboangueno Texts with Grammatical Analysis; A Study of Philippine Creole Spanish. A Thesis Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School of Cornell University for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy”
</i><br><br>by Michael Lawrence Forman, 1972. </p>

<h1>ORIGIN</h1>
<h3>The Source of the Tale</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><p>The story is included as one of the Chavacano texts in Forman’s 1972 Ph.D. dissertation, which documents and provides English translations of narrative texts in Zamboangueño Chabacano (a Philippine Creole Spanish) with grammatical analysis.</p>
</dl>
<h3>Linguistic Context</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><p>Forman’s dissertation was focused on linguistic description and analysis of Zamboangueño rather than folklore origins per se; the folktale serves primarily as linguistic data for grammatical analysis in the creole language.</p>
	<dt><p>So the inclusion of the tale reflects Zamboangueño narrative tradition as a source of authentic text samples rather than a study of its folklore origins.</p>
</dl>
<h3>Possible Roots of the Folklore</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><p>Folktale scholars generally note that Philippine folktales often draw on broad international folktale motifs (e.g., dragon fights, three brothers, quests) which have parallels in European, Asian, and indigenous Southeast Asian traditions. Philippine folktale collections like Dean Fansler’s highlight multiple cultural influences in Philippine oral tradition.</p>

<h1>Website Developer's Personal Reflection</h1>
<dl>
	<dt><p>As the website developer, reading <i>The Tale of the Dragon and the Three Brothers</i> made me reflect on how storytelling and technology have a similar foundation. The tale comes from a Zamboangueno oral tradition, but the patterns of the story feel similar to my digital experiences.
	The structure of the tale, the three brothers facing a challenge and attempting a solution, is similar to the way I approach development problems with my coding experience. In coding,
	I often test before arriving to the best solutions, just like the brothers encountering obstacles and consequences. The dragon, in a sense, represents complex technical problems. It's intimidating, however it can absolutely be overcomed through persistence and strategy.
	</p> <p> What amazed me the most thouogh, is how the tale was preserved through linguistic documentation. It fascinates me how tradition and culture is so strong, I had not even heard or read of the story until only recently. As a student, learning about creating websites, I see a strong
parallel between the tale and modern digital preservation. Website's aren't just tools, they preserve culture, language, and identity.	</p>
