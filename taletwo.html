<p>The dragon, being clever, did not eat the princess right away. Instead, it reasoned that as long as the girl remained alive, people would continue to come for her, and it could eat them without needing to fly to the kingdom each year. Weeks passed, and although many wished to rescue the princess, none were brave enough to lead an attempt. During this time, there lived in the kingdom a widower whose wife had died, leaving him with three unmarried sons. 
The eldest son was named Pedro, the second Pablo, and the youngest Juan. Pedro was an extraordinary marksman who could shoot with perfect accuracy from a great distance, even hitting the eye of a fly if he wished. Pablo was a tailor of remarkable skill, so fast and precise that he could sew a wound closed before blood could flow. Juan, the youngest, was a master thief who could steal anything, even while being watched, without being detected. Believing that their combined talents could succeed, the three brothers prepared a small rubber boat, inflated it, and set out for the island.

<p>When they arrived, they saw the dragon guarding the princess. The girl could not escape because the dragon remained close by. At that moment, the dragon was sleeping: six of its heads were asleep, while the other six were awake and watching. Juan told his brothers to wait in the boat while he went alone to steal the princess. Despite the dragon’s many watching eyes, Juan moved unseen and successfully carried the princess back to the boat. Since there was no motor in those days, the brothers began rowing toward the kingdom, a journey that would take several days. After many hours, the dragon awoke fully and discovered the princess was gone. Furious, it flew into the air to search for her. One of its twenty-four eyes spotted the brothers in the boat, and the dragon swooped down, intending to sink the boat and reclaim the girl.</p>

<p>Juan, having completed his task, told his brothers to do their part. Pedro took his rifle and, though the dragon was still far away, fired a shot directly into one of its eyes. The wounded dragon fell onto the boat, splitting it in two. Before the water could flood in, Pablo quickly sewed the boat back together. The dragon flew up again and attacked repeatedly. Each time it approached, Pedro shot out another eye, and each time it crashed onto the boat, Pablo repaired it before the brothers could drown. After many such attacks, Pedro shot out all twenty-four of the dragon’s eyes, and the dragon finally died.</p>
