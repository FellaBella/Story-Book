<p>At last, the brothers reached the kingdom with the princess. The people rejoiced, but a serious problem arose because of the king’s promise. Juan had stolen the princess, but without Pedro, the dragon would have overtaken them. Without Pablo, the boat would have sunk, and all would have died. Since each brother had been equally necessary, it was impossible to decide who should marry the princess. The king, who was said to be as wise as Solomon, considered the matter carefully. He declared that since the brothers’ father was a widower with no wife, it would be best if the father married the princess instead. The three brothers did not quarrel over this decision and accepted it willingly, pleased to have done a great favor for their father. The father married the princess, became king, and everyone lived happily, with no resentment among them. Goldish gold, the tale has been told</p>
