<br>
<p>Long ago, so it is said, in a distant place, there was a kingdom where the people lived peacefully and were always happy. They had plenty of food, and the people were not in the habit of quarreling with one another. The kingdom was ruled by a king who had three daughters, all of whom were very beautiful, as one would naturally expect of princesses. Although life in the kingdom was good, there was one great problem. </p>
<p>On a certain island lived a terrible dragon with twelve heads. Because the dragon could fly, each year it traveled to the kingdom, seized one person, carried that person back to its island, and ate them. </p>
<p>One year, out of all the people in the kingdom, the dragon took the youngest and most beautiful of the king’s daughters. The king was overwhelmed with grief and made a proclamation: whoever could free his daughter from the dragon would marry her, and when the king died, that man would become the next king. Many people, drawn by the princess’s beauty and the promise of the throne, traveled together to the island. However, when they saw the dragon, they were filled with fear and returned to the kingdom without attempting the rescue.
